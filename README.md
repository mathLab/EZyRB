## Description
**EZyRB** is a python library for the Model Order Reduction based on **baricentric triangulation** for the selection of the parameter points and on **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition** for the selection of the modes. It is ideally suited for actual industrial problems, since its structure can interact with several simulation software simply providing the output file of the simulations. Up to now, it handles files in the vtk and mat formats. It has been used for the model order reduction of problems solved with matlab and openFOAM.

See the [**Examples**](#examples) section below and the [**Tutorials**](tutorials/README.md) to have an idea of the potential of this package.

## Dependencies and installation
**EZyRB** requires `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `vtk`, `nose` (for local
        test) and `sphinx` (to generate the documentation). The code is
compatible with Python 2.7. It can be installed using `pip` or
directly from the source code.

### Installing via PIP
Mac and Linux users can install pre-built binary packages using pip.
To install the package just type: 
```bash
> pip install ezyrb
```
To uninstall the package:
```bash
> pip uninstall ezyrb
```

### Installing from source
The official distribution is on GitHub, and you can clone the repository using
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mathLab/EZyRB
```

To install the package just type:
```bash
> python setup.py install
```

To uninstall the package you have to rerun the installation and record the installed files in order to remove them:

```bash
> python setup.py install --record installed_files.txt
> cat installed_files.txt | xargs rm -rf
```

## Documentation
**EZyRB** uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) for code documentation. To build the html versions of the docs simply:

```bash
> cd docs
> make html
```

The generated html can be found in `docs/build/html`. Open up the `index.html` you find there to browse.


## Testing
We are using Travis CI for continuous intergration testing. You can check out the current status [here](https://travis-ci.org/mathLab/EZyRB).

To run tests locally:

```bash
> python test.py
```



## Examples

You can find useful tutorials on how to use the package in the [tutorials](tutorials/README.md) folder.
Here we show an application taken from the **automotive** engineering field

## How to contribute
We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

### Submitting a patch

  1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or
     feature you're intending to fix.  Even if you think it's relatively minor,
     it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial
     issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can
     be assigned to you.

  2. Follow the normal process of [forking][] the project, and setup a new
     branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in
     separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the
     commits related to that bug or feature.

  3. To ensure properly formatted code, please make sure to use 4
     spaces to indent the code. The easy way is to run on your bash the provided
     script: ./code_formatter.sh. You should also run [pylint][] over your code.
     It's not strictly necessary that your code be completely "lint-free",
     but this will help you find common style issues.

  4. Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests.  The
     project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing
     tests if you're unsure how to go about it. We're using [coveralls][] that
     is an invaluable tools for seeing which parts of your code aren't being
     exercised by your tests.

  5. Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages][] for each change.
     This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit
     messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.

  6. Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request][]. Please,
     remember to rebase properly in order to maintain a clean, linear git history.
